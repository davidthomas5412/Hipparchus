We can randomly select some portion of the data set to train the computer and then evaluate the \"accuracy\" of this classifier by testing it to the remaining portion. Do this multiple times. If the success rate of accurately classifying the \"un-trained\" Cepheids is high, then it is obvious that each galaxy has a distinctive characteristic; and vice versa."

The main task here would be to implement calulations of the evidence, ppp, etc. In light of the complexity of the original approach (which involved 22 parameters), we might adopt Phil's amazing analytic [solution](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/PHYS366-Homework-2017/blob/master/Week4/phil/Problem-UniversalCepheids.ipynb) to save time!"
